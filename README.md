# Can't Stop Game Instructions

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the classic game, "Can't Stop". 

## The Program!
Here is the program that you need to understand and explain in our questionnaire. The strategy implemented within this code is known as Couto's strategy, named after its developer.
```
def get_action(self, state):
    actions = state.available_moves()
    if actions == ['y', 'n']:
        score = ((DifficultyScore * DifficultyScore) - sum(map((lambda _ :sum(neutrals)), neutrals) + DifficultyScore + sum(map((lambda x : (progress_value * (NumberAdvancedThisRound * PositionsPlayerHasSecuredInColumn))), neutrals))

        if WinAfterN(state):
            return 'n'
        elif AreThereAvailableColumnsToPlay(state):
            return 'y'
        else:
            if score >= 29:
                return 'n'
            else:
                return 'y'
    else:
        index = argmax(map((lambda x : sum(map((lambda x : (PositionsPlayerHasSecuredInColumn + move_value)), locallist))), actions))
    return actions[index]
```
